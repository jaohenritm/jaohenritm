<h1>Data Science Projects Portfolio</h1>
	Welcome to my portfolio of projects. Here in this profile I want to demonstrate my capacity and abilities in resolving business problems using the concepts
	and the tools of the Data Science through projects realized using public data.
<h3>About Me</h3>
		The first time that I heard about Data Science was during my bachelor, more specifically in the econometrics subject, since then my interest in this area
		only has raised and I'm deeply focused in improving my capacity of resolving problems using the tools and concepts of the Data Science like data analytics
		and machine learning.
