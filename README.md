<h1>Welcome to my GitHub Page!</h1>
	<p/>My name is João Henrique Tavares.<br>
	Here in this profile you will encounter some projects that I realized focusing on awnsering and resolve business problems. In theses projects I used the concepts and the tools of the Data Science like data analysis, machine learning and statistics.
	
<h3>About Me</h3>
	The first time that I heard about Data Science was during my bachelor, more specifically in the econometrics subject, since then my interest in this area
	only has grown and I'm deeply focused in improving my capacity of resolving problems by learning more concepts and envolving my proficiency with Data Science tools.
