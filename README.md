<h3>About Me</h3>
	The first time that I heard about Data Science was during my bachelor, more specifically in the econometrics subject, since then my interest in this area
	only has grown and I'm deeply focused in improving my capacity of resolving problems by learning more about the tools of Data Science and how to use it.
